# COMP2007StreetSceneAssignment
 the project itself ended up being too big to push to github, so i have made a repository containing a compressed folder containing the project



credit to ZapSplat.com for the sound effects

sketchuptextureclub.com for the brick normal map and a concrete normal map which is used on some walls

filterforge.com for the pavement normal map

mixamo.com for the alien creature's model and animation (and for making my project too big to push to github.com)
